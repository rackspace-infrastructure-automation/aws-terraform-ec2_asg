# aws-terraform-ec2_asg

This module creates one or more autoscaling groups.

## Basic Usage

```
module "asg" {
 source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-ec2_asg//?ref=v0.0.2"

 ec2_os              = "amazon"
 subnets             = ["${module.vpc.private_subnets}"]
 image_id            = "${var.image_id}"
 resource_name       = "my_asg"
 security_group_list = ["${module.sg.private_web_security_group_id}"]
}
```
