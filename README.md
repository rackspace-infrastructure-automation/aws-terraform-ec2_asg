# aws-terraform-ec2\_asg

This module creates one or more autoscaling groups.

## Basic Usage

```HCL
module "asg" {
  source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-ec2_asg//?ref=v0.0.26"

  ec2_os              = "amazon"
  subnets             = ["${module.vpc.private_subnets}"]
  image_id            = "${var.image_id}"
  resource_name       = "my_asg"
  security_group_list = ["${module.sg.private_web_security_group_id}"]
}
```

### Module variables

The following variables are no longer neccessary and were removed:

* `install_scaleft_agent` - the old deprecated instance agent
